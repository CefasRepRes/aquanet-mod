# This is the name that will appear as your output directory. Make it descriptive

# Data collection period
# This is the period of time (in days) over which your LFM data was collected
# e.g. 365 * 4 (4 years)
data_collection_period: 1460

# tmax
# Maximum time (in days) for which each simulation can run
# e.g. 360 (days in a simulation year) * years
tmax: 3600

# Initial number of infections
# The default is one
# Adding more would simulate an outbreak resulting from multiple introductions
initial_no_infections: 1

# Catchment movement control options
# Set to 0, 1 or 2
# 0 = within catchment movements allowed
# 1 = between and within infected catchments allow
# 2 = no movement allowed by any sites within infected catchments
# None = no catchcment movement controls whatsoever

# Number of simulations to be run
  # Suggest 4 for a test, and 3000 for a full run

# Seed number
# Set the seed associated with pseudo-random number generation
# This will ensure your results are repeatable across runs
# Only change if you want to compare repeatability when using different seeds

# Set disease surveillance criteria
disease_controls: TRUE
contact_tracing: TRUE
remove_top_sites: FALSE
n_infections_remove_top_sites: 5 # MS: "when the cumulative number of infected sites exceeds 5"
n_top_sites_to_remove: 10 # MS: "movements are restricted both to and from the ten sites"

# Define disease seasonality
# Accepted character values listed within aquanet::isNonPeakTransmissionSeason()
# "180" = non peak transmission period is 180 days long
